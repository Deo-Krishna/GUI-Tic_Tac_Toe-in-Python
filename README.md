# GUI-Tic_Tac_Toe

## In this project you can find two files.
  The two files have same code.
  ### reason 
  This project has two files because of restart button.

### for example-
  If you open the "file 1" and press its restart button then it will close the file one and start file two, and vice versa.
  
# Important note - 
So you are requested to download the file, extract it, rename the folder with your choice of name and then enjoy the game.
If you wish to use the restart function then run the program on python terminal not on any editor like - pycharm and VScode

# Accessibilities
